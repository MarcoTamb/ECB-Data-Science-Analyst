# ECB Data Science Analyst
To apply to a position as Data Science Analyst I had to build three charts. Two excels providing data are included, I don't own the data, but the sources are listed in the notebook.

Unfortunately, I did not document the requirements, but it should be a pretty standard stack: pandas, openpyxl, ipywidgets and plotly, if I didn't forget something minor.
