    "# Importing and manipulating data \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python, one first reads the `.xlsx` files. One can then manipulate the data to compute the Euro Area aggregate for the first chart, aggregate the countries by income group for the second chart and add a column for each country showing which region it is in. Then the charts are built using Plotly. ECB colour scheme is used for your convenience, for consistency. Income groups are plugged-in by hand (still using Python) to account for some slight labelling differences between the `CLASS.xlsx` file and the `EDGAR_2024_GHG_booklet_2024.xlsx` file. (see code for details)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first and second chart, bar charts are chosen. To show contribution of countries and continents to GHG emissions, a Treemap chart is used. Thanks to Plotly, interactivity is available in Jupyter; furthermore, the charts can easily be integrated in a Dash dashboard. [You can check out the code on my Github (link)](https://github.com/MarcoTamb/)"
